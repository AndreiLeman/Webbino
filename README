Sukkino
=======
Sukkino is a collection of libraries for the Arduino platform. I originally
wrote them for my own projects but I think many arduinists can take advantage
from them.

All the libraries come with included examples to show how they can be used.
Please also have a look at each library's header files, since the library
behaviour can often be fine-tuned from there.


Webbino
=======
Webbino is a webserver for Arduino with the following features:
- Compatible with both the official Ethernet Shield (based on WizNet's W5100
  chip) and ENC28J60-based shields. This is a unique feature of Webbino, as far
  as I know.
- HTML pages and other data get embedded in the code. This avoids the need of
  an SD card (and, consequently, of the SD access libraries).
- Tags like "#SOMETHING#" in HTML pages can be replaced at page request time,
  allowing the delivery of dynamic contents.

Panic
=====
Panic is a small library that allows writing runtime assertions in Arduino
code, just like the standard C assert.h header. It supports both the standard
assert() mechanism, as well as the glib-inspired assert_not_reached() feature.
Panic will halt the program and print a message on the Serial port and can also
blink a led connected to an Arduino pin whenever an assertion fails.
Assertions can be totally disabled by defining the NDEBUG symbol at compile
time.

EEPROMAnything
==============
EEPROMAnything is just the merger of the functions available on the Arduino
Playground at http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/EEPROMWriteAnything with
the functions of the official EEPROM library, so that you only need to include
a single library to be able to read and write both individual bytes and
arbitrary objects. It also supports a mechanism that transparently redirects
all read/writes to a different EEPROM offset, in order to save write cycles.
